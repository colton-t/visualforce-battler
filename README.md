# Visualforce Project: Pokemon Battler

This project is a Pokemon Battler that allows users to simulate battles against challenging Pokemon teams using the PokeAPI and a Visualforce user interface. The user is able to create a team of six Pokemon and battle against randomly generated teams or against player teams from another participating org. Other participating orgs can pull created teams to battle against as well.
